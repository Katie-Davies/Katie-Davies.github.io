            <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>
              My career plan is to find an area of software development that
              excites me, working for a company that is forward thinking and
              wants to make a change in peoples lives where and what type of
              development that is I am still not sure. I think I would also at
              some poiint like to make use of my teaching background and maybe
              go into teaching software development further down the track. Even
              if this is on the side to my own job.
            </p>

            <h2>
              What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be
              in Bootcamp?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Looking back on my Sprint 2 strengths and limitations I think my
              self-confidence in my own ability is starting to increase, knowing
              that I have been able to complete some of these challenges on my
              own and actually fully understand what the heck I just did has ben
              awesome. However I think I still have a limitation of self-doubt
              when I hit a brick wall and making sure I take the time to have a
              break. Making sure I put my mental wellbeing first and am being
              mindful of how I feel in a moment and using the tools around me. I
              think being at bootcamp and being around others it might be easier
              to remember this as others will also need breaks and time for
              mindfulness. I think my strengths are still the same but I would
              like to add knowing where and how to look for help if I need it.

            <h2>
              What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
              will be?
            </h2>
            <p>
              For me it will be speaking and presenting in front of big groups.
              I absolutely hate doing this. Even if I am confident in what I am
              talking about I get so nervous that I stutter and forget what it
              is I am trying to get across. This is a big one for me! Give me a
              class of 90 kids and I am all good, a room with 10 adults and I
              fall to pieces!
            </p>
            <p>
              I think also the long hours and not being the primary caregiver of
              my son will be tough but knowing this is all so I can be a better
              person for him helps!

            </h2>
            <p>
              I would say recieving feedback, I am all good when it is
              constructive and specific but for me it is all about the delivery
              and I guess my own reaction when they are delivering it in a rude
              way. Making sure I take what I can from it and leave the emotion
              out of it.

            <p>
              To build a safe space where I feel welcomed, supported and valued.
              I want them to use humour to help us get through the long hours
              and to also genuinely believe and be invested in our learning
              journey. I know we are adults and our motivation should be
              intrinsic but I also believe that a teacher plays a powerful role
              in how a student sees themself! For me this will look like them
              taking the time to listen and offer advice, being present in times
              of anxiety and stress, and also encouraging when we need it!

              To dive straight in, to be resilient and brave when taking on new

              worrying about looking stupid. Also to make sure I take the time
              to reflect on how well I am doing and what is a stressor or worry
              for me at that moment and what can I do to help me through!

            <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>
              My long term career goal as a developer has a few different paths
              1 . I would like to work for a company that creates something to
              help support the education system i.e. something like Storypark or
              Schooltalks. 2. I would also like to have some experience in the
              cloud Azure or AWS area as I know this is a big need across NZ at
              the moment however I am not sure if it would fulfil my creative
              side hence the goal to work for a company that creates new things.
              3. To work for a company that has a great culture, supports growth
              and development and is supportive. I am still not sure which area
              I want to focus on within this career goal, I know this is a step
              I need to take so I am more present in my son's life and am able
              to have more flexibility within my career. I also like that there
              are so many avenues I can take in software development, one thing
              that was hard in teaching was that there wasn’t much of a career
              path if you did not want to go into management. I love the
              possibilities that come with being a software developer.

            <h2>
              A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
              learning
            </h2>
            <p>
              My strengths when it comes to learning is I am organised, I like
              to stick to timelines and also clear roadmaps of what is expected.
              My time as a teacher has meant I have developed excellent planning
              skills and being able to break down tasks into small simple steps.
              Also as a teacher we are constantly having to reflect on our
              practice so I have strong skills on reflecting on my learning and
              identifying my gaps and making a plan on how I can fill them. My
              limitation is probably my self-confidence. In teaching I feel
              confident in my ability, I know my pedagogy and my skills, I feel
              comfortable in trying new approaches as my core skills are solid.
              Going back to being a complete newbie is scary and I don’t feel
              like I have core skills to fall back on. So I guess making sure I
              am not afraid to ask for help, ask stupid questions and the
              biggest thing is not comparing myself to others and their learning
              journey.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>
              What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to
              see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
            </h2>
            <p>
              The core skills I would like to see develop is how to share when I
              do not agree in the corporate world. In teaching we don’t really
              get a say about the approach we are using, the lead informs us and
              then we do. It is odd knowing I am going into a world when I can
              voice if I’m not sure something is the correct way to go or there
              might be a different approach, so I guess being able to voice my
              opinion in the right way.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>
              A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
              programme. This should include:
            </h2>
            <h3>
              An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
              productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
              industry/community representatives
            </h3>
            <p>
              One way that I think is important in making others feel safe is
              understanding that everyone learns differently, changing your
              approach if the other person is not understanding, asking them to
              explain in a different way. Being patient with one another and not
              being afraid to be vulnerable with my group and ask for support
              when I need. One tool that I have learnt is asking people what is
              important to them to be effective in a group before starting any
              work. Knowing what each other needs to be successful. Also Flex
              and core, when working in a group knowing what is a core thing for
              someone and what they are willing to flex on. For example I am
              flex on creativity but I am core on being on time. One way I will
              ensure I work productively is making sure I organise myself and I
              am clear about what my role/participation is, knowing what is
              expected of me. Making sure I am always on time with my work.
            </p>
            <h3>
              What you will do when things are building up and starting to get
              to you?
            </h3>
            <p>
              When I feel things are building up I find I need to step away for
              a moment. Break down what is needed into small chunks, and write a
              to do list based on priority. I find being able to check things of
              a list helps me to stay on track. I also have a very supportive
              husband who is willing to take on more responsibility and give me
              the support I need to succeed. Another thing would be to use the
              support available to me within this course, look at what is
              causing me the most issue, and figuring out how I can approach it.

            <p>
              As I go through the day I like to write on a post it the areas I
              needed more support in. I then try and find more resources to
              support these learning needs, if I still feel unsure I then will
              seek help from my fellow students and facilitators. As a learner I
              know I do not feel comfortable moving forward until I am feeling
              confident in my learning so far. This means I need to act quick on
              areas I am unsure in. Again fighting my anxiety about asking a
              stupid question will come into this too.

            <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
            <p>
              My expectation would be for them to be understanding and
              supportive. Making sure I feel safe enough to ask a question and
              not be worried about the response. To be encouraging and to add
              lightness and fun into what will be an intense time in our lives.

            <p>
              Currently I do not have any commitments as my husband will be

              that I would like to block off is saturday mornings just so I can
              still do swimming with my son however this is flexible.
