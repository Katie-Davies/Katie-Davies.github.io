        <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>
          My long term career goal as a developer has a few different paths 1 .
          I would like to work for a company that creates something to help
          support the education system i.e. something like Storypark or
          Schooltalks. 2. I would also like to have some experience in the cloud
          Azure or AWS area as I know this is a big need across NZ at the moment
          however I am not sure if it would fulfil my creative side hence the
          goal to work for a company that creates new things. 3. To work for a
          company that has a great culture, supports growth and development and
          is supportive. I am still not sure which area I want to focus on
          within this career goal, I know this is a step I need to take so I am
          more present in my son's life and am able to have more flexibility
          within my career. I also like that there are so many avenues I can
          take in software development, one thing that was hard in teaching was
          that there wasn’t much of a career path if you did not want to go into
          management. I love the possibilities that come with being a software
          developer.

        <h2>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h2>
        <p>
          My strengths when it comes to learning is I am organised, I like to
          stick to timelines and also clear roadmaps of what is expected. My
          time as a teacher has meant I have developed excellent planning skills
          and being able to break down tasks into small simple steps. Also as a
          teacher we are constantly having to reflect on our practice so I have
          strong skills on reflecting on my learning and identifying my gaps and
          making a plan on how I can fill them. My limitation is probably my
          self-confidence. In teaching I feel confident in my ability, I know my
          pedagogy and my skills, I feel comfortable in trying new approaches as
          my core skills are solid. Going back to being a complete newbie is
          scary and I don’t feel like I have core skills to fall back on. So I
          guess making sure I am not afraid to ask for help, ask stupid
          questions and the biggest thing is not comparing myself to others and
          their learning journey.

        <h2>
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The core skills I would like to see develop is how to share when I do
          not agree in the corporate world. In teaching we don’t really get a
          say about the approach we are using, the lead informs us and then we
          do. It is odd knowing I am going into a world when I can voice if I’m
          not sure something is the correct way to go or there might be a
          different approach, so I guess being able to voice my opinion in the
          right way.

        <h2>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
          This should include:
        </h2>
        <h3>
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
          and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
          representatives
        </h3>
        <p>
          One way that I think is important in making others feel safe is
          understanding that everyone learns differently, changing your approach
          if the other person is not understanding, asking them to explain in a
          different way. Being patient with one another and not being afraid to
          be vulnerable with my group and ask for support when I need. One tool
          that I have learnt is asking people what is important to them to be
          effective in a group before starting any work. Knowing what each other
          needs to be successful. Also Flex and core, when working in a group
          knowing what is a core thing for someone and what they are willing to
          flex on. For example I am flex on creativity but I am core on being on
          time. One way I will ensure I work productively is making sure I
          organise myself and I am clear about what my role/participation is,
          knowing what is expected of me. Making sure I am always on time with
          my work.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
          you?
        </h3>
        <p>
          When I feel things are building up I find I need to step away for a
          moment. Break down what is needed into small chunks, and write a to do
          list based on priority. I find being able to check things of a list
          helps me to stay on track. I also have a very supportive husband who
          is willing to take on more responsibility and give me the support I
          need to succeed. Another thing would be to use the support available
          to me within this course, look at what is causing me the most issue,
          and figuring out how I can approach it.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h2>
        <p>
          As I go through the day I like to write on a post it the areas I
          needed more support in. I then try and find more resources to support
          these learning needs, if I still feel unsure I then will seek help
          from my fellow students and facilitators. As a learner I know I do not
          feel comfortable moving forward until I am feeling confident in my
          learning so far. This means I need to act quick on areas I am unsure
          in. Again fighting my anxiety about asking a stupid question will come
          into this too.

        <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
        <p>
          My expectation would be for them to be understanding and supportive.
          Making sure I feel safe enough to ask a question and not be worried
          about the response. To be encouraging and to add lightness and fun
          into what will be an intense time in our lives.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Currently I do not have any commitments as my husband will be taking
          on the role as primary care giver for our son. My only time that I
          would like to block off is saturday mornings just so I can still do
          swimming with my son however this is flexible.
