              What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your
              ego due to the core learning?
            </h2>
            <p>Three new things I have learnt are :</p>
            <ul>
              <li>My values- how they had changed from the last time</li>
              <li>
                How much mindful breathing really does help me to center myself
                again and focus
              </li>
              <li>
                That even though I have been exposed to a lot of this skills and
                strategies how little I was using them in my own learning path.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              With regards to my own ego, my stubborness to give up and seek
              help before getting to the point of frustration and defeat. Not
              seeing as needing help as failing in my own ability.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>
              What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in
              learning and programming?
            </h2>
            <p>
              These are all important when you are on a learning journey.
              Firstly your values, who you are as a person and what your drive
              for the learning is will play into why you started the journey and
              your goals. You need to want to learn and be your own motivator.
              Learning is extremely hard if you are not invested in the outcome.
            </p>
            <p>
              When thinking of empathy in learning and programming there is a
              number of ways empathy will be important. Empathy towards others
              and their learning journey or project. When they are seeking
              support and guidance from you as a peer, emphasising on the hard
              work and effort they have already put in and not belittling their
              effort. Showing empathy towards them will build trust and a safe
              space for people to want to ask for support. Secondly empathy
              towards yourself and the effort and hard work you are also putting
              in. Making sure that when you are hitting a brick wall that you
              are empathetic towards yourself and not listening to that little
              voice in your head that is dismissing all the hard work you have
              done so far.
            </p>
            <p>
              This then links onto self-awareness. Having the courage to take on
              a new learning step like this or once in the work place a new
              project there are a few ways that I can think of the role of
              self-awareness.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Being self-aware of your own ability and being honest about
                where you are on your learning journey and seeking the help you
                need.
              </li>
              <li>
                Being self-aware of your emotions and how you are feeling that
                day. Are you in a good head space? Making sure you are not being
                harsh or rude towards others due to your own stressors. Making
                sure you are still using kindess towards others.
              </li>
              <li>
                Being self-aware of how your actions effects others especially
                when working on a project. Knowing that you are part of a team
                and everyone has a part to play.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
              Just my own fascination with how the brain and body work. I love
              reading about growth mindset and the power of lnaguage and how
              much effect it has on how we see ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also not realising how much of the core curriculum I was already
              teaching in my own proactice.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>
              Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much
              time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp
              course?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Core plays a huge part on how you see yourself as person and a
              learner. By focusing on skills that will make you feel better
              about yourself, improve your resilience, and communication skills
              you are in turn making better developers who are not afraid to
              take risks, ask for help but also feel confident on who they are
              as a person. It will improve all aspects of their life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Companies want to employ people who are reflective on their work,
              people who are keen to improve and carry on learning. By
              understanding aspects such as neuroplasticity and growth mindset,
              you will know that you can develop your skills and that it is
              important for brain neurons to continue your professional
              development so those pathways become stronger.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>
              Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
              waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
              programming instead?
            </h2>
            <p>
              No way, I think strategies on how to help you become a better
              learner and communicator is invaluable. These are skills that will
              help you in all aspects of your life not just in programming.
              Especially strategies on how to help your mental wellbeing. This
              is so important to make sure you are in the right headspace to be
              able to learn. Coming from a teaching background the biggest
              aspect I focused on was building relationships and how students
              percieve themselves as learners as if they didn't feel safe and
              feel ok with taking on challenges, learning would not be
              successful, same for adults!
