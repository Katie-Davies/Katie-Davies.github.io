        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h2>
      <p>
        A situation where I had to make an ethical decision was when a child
        disclosed to me that they were having a hard time, dealing with a lot of
        new emotions and changes at home. I knew that they were in a very
        vulnerable state and it took a lot for them to confide in me. The issue
        was becoming quite serious particularly in the safety of the child. I
        had to make the decision of keeping the childs trust with myself in tact
        or putting the safety of the child first and speaking to their family.
        After much thinking about all the options I wanted the child to still
        have a safe space to be able to talk and share so I approach the child
        first about conversing with their parents together and how much
        information they were willing to share, what did they want be to be? a
        supportve figure or speaking for them. This made the student feel in
        control and I was able to also make sure the saftey of the child was at
        the front of everyones minds.
