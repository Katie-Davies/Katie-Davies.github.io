          <h2>
            Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
            how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
            decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
          </h2>
          <p>
            A situation where I had to make an ethical decision was when a child
            disclosed to me that they were having a hard time, dealing with a
            lot of new emotions and changes at home. I knew that they were in a
            very vulnerable state and it took a lot for them to confide in me.
            The issue was becoming quite serious particularly in the safety of
            the child. I had to make the decision of keeping the childs trust
            with myself in tact or putting the safety of the child first and
            speaking to their family. After much thinking about all the options
            I wanted the child to still have a safe space to be able to talk and
            share so I approach the child first about conversing with their
            parents together and how much information they were willing to
            share, what did they want be to be? a supportve figure or speaking
            for them. This made the student feel in control and I was able to
            also make sure the saftey of the child was at the front of everyones
            minds.

          <h2>
            Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
            your values and identity.
          </h2>
          <p>
            I can think of many ways that the culture and people around me have
            influenced me. A huge one would be moving to NZ at 23, the people
            who I surround myself now are my core friends. When starting over in
            a new country you get to reflect and think about the types of people
            you want to connect with, my main thing was that they were
            supportive, encouraging and fun! I knew the friends I would make
            would become my NZ whanau. I think different people influence you in
            different ways, some of my people help me to notice all things I am
            awesome at that I don't know, others teach you how to reflect, some
            help you to remember to take a leap on the wild side. But overall I
            think knowing I have their support, confidence and love no matter
            what is what matters most to my identity and values. Culture is a
            huge one, when we left the UK it was because we were not happy with
            the work/life culture. I think it is important to know your worth
            and to know when your wellbeing has to come first. This is a reason
            I left teaching as the culture was starting to effect me as a
            person, my identity was changing as I was missing parts of myself
            due to the culture of workload. This helped me to be able to
            identify when I am at my limit and being ok with saying no.

            Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
            learning journey.
          </h2>

          <p>
            These are my five top strengths from the tests I have completed
            online. Love - This is what is driving me to push myself out of my
            comfort zone and challenge myself with a new career. The love and
            support from my whanau is giving me the confidence to put myself out
            there. Also my love for them is what drives me to better myself so I
            can be better for them.
