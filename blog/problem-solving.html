            <h2>A time I was stuck...</h2>
            <p>
              This was when I was trying to figure out how to add all the new
              test scores to each student in the gradebook. I took a minute and
              reread the task again a few times and jotted down what I thought I
              would need to do to solve the problem. To make it easier I thought
              how would I write the code if I wanted to add the testscore to
              just one of the students. This helped me get into the process of
              how the code may look. Then I knew I need to use a loop but wasn't
              sure how to use a loop within an array. This is when I turned to
              Google and found the .forEach method. Then it was a simple step of
              adapting my code into the .forEach method and testing to see if it
              worked. There was a lot of trial and error and reading the error
              messages.
            </p>
            <p>
              Througout the process I would find myself getting frustrated that
              I didn't know better or for making silly mistakes but after taking
              a break and talking to my husband he reminded me that it is all
              part of the learning process and even seasoned developers still
              make silly mistakes.
            </p>
            <h3>What did I learn...</h3>
            <p>
              I learnt to be easier on myself. That it isn't failing using the
              tools around you to help. That to be mindful of productive
              struggle but also knowing when to seek help.

            <h2>Elegantly solved a problem ...</h2>
            <p>
              Creating my superBuzzFizz function. I felt so confident with what
              I needed to do, the only bit I was unsure was the exact syntax I
              needed to use to call upon a function within a function. I broke
              my code down into steps and fully understood how each part worked
              but then when I hit test it came back fail! I was so annoyed as I
              was so sure my code was on the right path. I looked at the error
              message it was showing and still wasn't sure. I put my code into
              chatGPT and they said it was all correct and should work, so my
              frustration was rising! I finaly thought something had stuck and I
              was improving then to keep getting fail really hit hard. So I went
              for a walk and did some mindful breathing. Then came back and
              looked at the test file, that is when it hit me I had put my code
              into the same file as fizzBuzz when it needed to be in the
              superFizzBuzz one I felt so stupid! I copied over my code and hit
              run and boom it worked! My eagerness to keep going with my
              learning meant I missed the part about completing it in the other
              file.

            <h2>Techniques</h2>

            <h4>Pseudocode:</h4>
            <p>
              Becoming more confident- I use to write myself notes in a notepad
              so now just using pseudocode instead. Definitely helps me break
              down my thinking.
            </p>
            <h4>Trying something:</h4>
            <p>
              Semi-confident, I feel this is just how I approach most problems
              by just giving somthing a go and then processing why it did or
              didn't work. Trying not to worry if I'll break something by trying
              though!
            </p>
            <h4>Rubber Ducky method:</h4>
            <p>
              Very confident, I am constantly talking out loud about what I am
              doing and most times I head to others to get help and whilst I am
              thinkning of how I will relay my problem to them I come up with a
              solution.
            </p>
            <h4>Read Error Messages:</h4>
            <p>
              Not really, still trying to understand what they are telling me
              and what that means. I am working on it and have researched
              different type of error messages.
            </p>
            <h4>Console.logging:</h4>
            <p>
              Semi-confident, I have only really used it when instructed too and
              couldn't figure out how I used it on my own code locally. Then
              after some Googling it all clicked. I used it for a few of my
              functions on the kata project. Will Definitely start using it more
              now I understand how to!
            </p>
            <h4>Googling:</h4>
            <p>Confindent! Google is my lifeline when all else fails!</p>
            <h4>Asking peers for help:</h4>
            <p>
              Semi-confident- It takes me a while to feel comfortable and safe
              with my peers to ask and not really knowning everyone properly yet
              makes me nervous.
            </p>
            <h4>Asking coaches for help:</h4>
            <p>
              Semi-confident- I have yet to get to the point where I have needed
              to as I have managed to find the answer either through google or
              trial and error. I think once we start getting more into projects
              and in person I will definitely be more confident.
            </p>
            <h4>Improving your process with reflection:</h4>
            <p>
              Semi-confident- When I have my 'a ha' moment I should reflect more
              on how I got there and what I did to be successful, but also
              taking a moment and reflecting when something isn't going right
              and what do I need for my own mental health in that moment.

            <h2>I was reluctant to ask for help...</h2>
            <p>
              I always struggle with this as I want to be able to figure things
              out on my own, I know I learn best by making mistakes and then
              fixing them, having something to connect my research too helps me
              to solidify my learning. However like I previously said knowing
              how long is long enough to try and figure something out before I
              ask for help is a struggle. But more importantly knowing that
              asking for help doesn't mean I failed.
