          <h2>A time I was stuck...</h2>
          <p>
            This was when I was trying to figure out how to add all the new test
            scores to each student in the gradebook. I took a minute and reread
            the task again a few times and jotted down what I thought I would
            need to do to solve the problem. To make it easier I thought how
            would I write the code if I wanted to add the testscore to just one
            of the students. This helped me get into the process of how the code
            may look. Then I knew I need to use a loop but wasn't sure how to
            use a loop within an array. This is when I turned to Google and
            found the .forEach method. Then it was a simple step of adapting my
            code into the .forEach method and testing to see if it worked. There
            was a lot of trial and error and reading the error messages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Througout the process I would find myself getting frustrated that I
            didn't know better or for making silly mistakes but after taking a
            break and talking to my husband he reminded me that it is all part
            of the learning process and even seasoned developers still make
            silly mistakes.
          </p>
          <h3>What did I learn...</h3>
          <p>
            I learnt to be easier on myself. That it isn't failing using the
            tools around you to help. That to be mindful of productive struggle
            but also knowing when to seek help.

          <h2>Techniques</h2>

          <h5>Pseudocode:</h5>
          <p>
            Becoming more confident- I use to write myself notes in a notepad so
            now just using pseudocode instead. Definitely helps me break down my
            thinking.
          </p>
          <h5>Trying something:</h5>
          <p>
            very confident, I feel this is just how I approach most problems by
            just giving somthing a go and then processing why it did or didn't
            work. Better to just try!
          </p>
          <h5>Rubber Ducky method:</h5>
          <p>
            Very confident, I am constantly talking out loud about what I am
            doing and most times I head to others to get help and whilst I am
            thinkning of how I will relay my problem to them I come up with a
            solution.
          </p>
