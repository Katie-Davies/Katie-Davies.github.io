An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.-->

          <h3>Analogy to describe JS and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>
          <p>
            Imagine we had a puppet show. We begin our show with just HTML so we
            only have a static black outline of a puppet on a stick. We then add
            in our CSS our pupper now has a bright colourful outfit and
            excellent facial expression, however it is still static it does not
            respond to anything. This is where JS comes in. When we add in the
            JS code the puppet will begin to act and respond to the audience.

        <h3>
          Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
          life
        </h3>
        <p>A control flow in everyday life could be making a sandwich:</p>

        <ul id="controlFlow">
          <li>Get the bread</li>
          <li>Spread the butter on the bread</li>
          <li>Add ham to bread</li>
          <li>Put tomato on the ham</li>
          <li>put lettuce on the tomato</li>
          <li>put a slice of bread on the lettuce</li>
          <li>Cut the sandwich in the middle</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You complete the sequence in this order everytime.</p>
        <p>
          Then the loop would be if you made another sandwich for someone else
          in your family, you would then repeat this sequence until the number
          of sandwiches needed are made.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
          it.
        </h3>
        <p>
          In my own words the DOM is a tree structure where all the parts of the
          document are kept. Every element will have a parent, and may have a
          child element. You use the DOM to interact and manipulate the content
          of a webpage. Whenever an action is made on a website it is flipping
          through the DOM to find the right element to perform that action on.
          It is the behind the scenes framework that allows the webpage to
          respond to the users actions. <br />
          With regards to interacting with the DOM you may use it to try out a
          new piece of code, check for bugs or even to collect data from your
          website usage.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
        </h3>
        <h4>Arrays</h4>
        <p>
          An array is a collection of data that is stored together i.e let
          animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'mouse', 'rabbit']. It maintains the elements
          in the same order each time using index numbers i.e index 0 = 'cat'
          index 1 = 'dog', these index numbers are also how to access the data.
          Arrays have built in methods such as 'push', 'pop' and 'for each'
        </p>
        <h4>Objects</h4>
        <p>
          Objects are also a collection of data however the data is stored in
          Key-Value pairs. <br />
          For example let animals = {name: Dog, color: black, size: large}
          <br />
          You then access the value data using the key i.e animal.size would
          return large. The data in an object is not stored in a specific order
          and the order may change. Objects do not have any built in methods but
          is more flexible for storing data.
        </p>
        <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
        <p>
          A function is letting the computer know what you want it to do (i.e.
          set of instructions) when a certain input happens. For example every
          time I click sign in I want the log in page to load. They are helpful
          because they are reusable pieces of code and they help to organise
          your code into readable chunks.
