            <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
            <h3>
              Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity
              benefits people.
            </h3>
            <p>
              There are a number of ways the principle of neuroplasticity
              benefits people. One is personal growth and learning, as we grow
              we are constantly changing as people and learning new things. By
              understanding neuroplasticity you will know that at any point in
              your life you can learn something new. Your brain is not a fixed
              state, you can improve and change your way of thinking and your
              knowledge. You can teach an old dog new tricks!
            </p>
            <p>
              A second way is in rehabilitation, knowing that your brain is
              malleable and can be rewired is helpful for people who have had
              strokes and may need their body to act in a different way from
              before. Therapists can focus on the one area of the brain that
              will help with rehabilitation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thirdly, knowing you can overcome challenges, knowing that you can
              build resilience and that by failing and making mistakes you are
              building pathways in your brain that will get stronger and
              stronger. Being ok with being in the learning pit, feeling the
              struggle and growing your neurons so you can come out the other
              side. Change is possible with effort, persistence, and the right
              interventions.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>
              Discuss how you might engage with the principles of
              neuroplasticity for your benefit.
            </h3>
            <p>
              The way that I find myself engaging with neuroplasticity is
              reminding myself that if something is hard it won’t always be
              hard. If I keep working on it and practicing soon it will become
              another thing I do autonomously. I think I use it alot when I am
              stuck and making mistakes. I remind myself to take a break, use
              the resources around me and don’t be afraid to ask for help.
              Coming from a teaching background where we focus on growth mindset
              a lot, that ‘a ha’ moment when you finally get something is the
              best feeling, and even better if you have struggled along the way!

          <div>
            <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
            <p>Some of the ways are:</p>
            <p>
              Learning challenges- taking on new learning that will engage your
              brain such as reading, solving puzzles, learning a new language,
              or engaging in a new hobby like knitting, surfing. A hobby where
              you have to use a whole new skill set.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mindfulness- it promotes structural change in the brain which is
              associated with emotional regulation and stress resilience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Physical exercise- The research shows that by performing 30
              minutes of exercise as day it increases production in the part of
              the brain which supports the growth and survival of neurons.
            </p>
            <p>
              Socialising- By engaging in meaningful interactions we improve and
              maintain our neurons that focus on areas such as communication,
              empathy and emotions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly sleep!! Sleep is so essential for our brain. This is the
              time where our brain processes our memories, clears toxins and
              consolidates our memories.

            <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
            <p>
              Growth mindset is all about how you think about yourself and your
              attitude towards learning. It is how you view setbacks and
              failures and the approach you take towards challenges. It is also
              how you talk to yourself with that little inner voice. Growth
              mindset is relevant in everyday life but even more so when you are
              starting a new learning journey, the way you will face the
              challenges along the way, how will you respond to set-backs and
              feedback, your persistence and effort in achieving your goals. As
              a person supporting people with a growth mindset praising their
              effort, persistence and problem solving skills rather than how
              fast or how correct they were.

              In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Not really as I have been teaching growth mindset and using it as
              part of my pedagogy for nearly 10 years. I love listening to Carol
              Dweck and I think it is such an important concept for everyone to
              know and understand so that they know that they are capable of
              anything.

            <h3>
              How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
            </h3>
            <p>
              The biggest tool that I integrate into my own learning is ensuring
              I always say ‘yet’ to myself. I am also starting to use the tool
              of what is a different way I could approach this. I think for my
              growth though I am focusing on how I receive feedback and what I
              do with that feedback. I have always linked feedback to I have
              failed. This has been a big learning curve for me and feeling ok
              with knowing there is always room for improvement.

            <h3>
              Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or
              influence your learning plan and strategy.
            </h3>
            <p>
              These understandings will shape my learning plan by looking at the
              tools around me, what can I do when I am in a pit and struggling.
              What can I use to help pull me out? Making sure I don’t let my
              fear of asking for help hinder my learning. Putting myself in my
              students shoes and taking my own advice on what being a learner
              looks like. Praising my effort and resilience rather than the
              ‘right’ answer!
            </p>
            As mentioned above, changing how I perceive and process feedback. I
            think this also has a lot to do with how the feedback is delivered
            as well, but making sure I personally am open and accepting but also
            knowing when and how to use that feedback.
